# Basie

A statically typed systems language for Z80 machines, compiled to native code
in a single pass, with memory whose lifetime the compiler can see.

## The name

Basie is BASIC with the C dropped, and a nod to Count Basie, who was famous
for playing few notes and making every one of them count. That is the
language's whole approach: a BASIC that reads like the structured BASICs and
Pascals of the CP/M era, with keyword-led statements, `if`/`elseif`/`end`,
counted `for` loops and `select` with `case`, compiled in a single pass to
Z80 machine code in which every byte has to justify itself. The twist is
underneath: static types, and memory safety without a garbage collector,
where every object has one owner, access is lent to a routine for the length
of a call, and no reference can outlive the storage it points into.

*Few notes. Make them count.*

## Status

The current toolchain development line is **0.1**. Version **1.0** is reserved
for the language when it is ready to stabilize; the proposed 1.0 specification
remains a working draft. It is not a delivered 1.0 release.

The native compiler `BASIE.COM` and linker `BLINK.COM` run on CP/M 2.2. Roadmap
step 74 records completion of the current implementation scope; open arrays of handles
and `File`s followed with the open-array descriptor correction ([limits](docs/limits.md)). Plain nominal enums are implemented in both compilers as the first next-milestone feature
([types](spec/06-types.md#616-plain-enumerations)), followed by exhaustive value selection (D51,
[select](spec/11-conditional-control.md#117-select)), colon types (D52), `try` (D48),
call-site `var` (D49) and enum failure domains (D54), which complete the milestone's first
tier. `BASIE.COM` takes 25,645 resident bytes and a 2,560-byte overlay area, 467 bytes under
its 28 KiB limit.

The [forward development plan](docs/development-plan.md) records the next milestone's
selected directions and admission gates. No next release number is assigned.
This is the work previously discussed as "version two"; its accepted scope is
unchanged. No tag or release publication is implied by these labels.

## What Basie is

Basie is a small, strictly specified language compiled to native Z80 code by
a compiler that itself runs on the Z80, in one streaming pass. It is meant for
general use: it has signed and unsigned integers of 8, 16 and 32 bits,
floating point, storage that lives only as long as a routine call or a pool
slot's owner, and a linker that drops unused code from the output.

Its foundations:

- **Single-pass compilation.** The compiler reads its source once.
  Declarations come before use, and a forward declaration is a routine's
  complete signature.
- **Static types, no tags.** Every value's representation is known at compile
  time, so nothing at run time spends bits or cycles rediscovering it.
- **Plain syntax.** Statements end at a newline, blocks end with `end`, and
  control flow uses words such as `if`, `elseif`, `for` and `and`. The style is
  closer to BASIC and Lua than to C.
- **Second-class references.** Routines receive aggregates by alias, and an
  alias can't be stored, so it can never dangle.
- **Checked safety.** Out-of-range indexing, narrowing conversions and division
  by zero trap rather than corrupting memory.
- **Tree shaking.** A separate link step places only the routines, data and
  runtime helpers the program can reach.

## Building and running

The toolchain is built and tested with [Deno](https://deno.com):

```
deno task test       # the whole test suite
deno task release    # build/BASIE.DSK, a bootable CP/M 2.2 disk
deno task disktime   # a build's time on modelled 8-inch and 5.25-inch floppies
```

The release disk holds `BASIE.COM`, the compiler, with its overlays
(`BASIE.OVL`) and messages (`BASIE.MSG`); `BLINK.COM`, the linker;
`CPM22.BRL`, the runtime library; the standard library's parts; and the
examples. On CP/M, `BASIE ADVENT` compiles `ADVENT.BSI` and links
`ADVENT.COM`.

## The principle

> What can be known before the program runs should be decided before it runs.
> The machine should pay at run time only for what can't be known any earlier.

This is why Basie compiles instead of interpreting, uses static types instead
of runtime tags, checks storage lifetimes at compile time instead of collecting
garbage, and chooses addresses only once it knows which code is live.

## Terms

These terms are provisional, but the documents use them consistently.

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **holder** | The variable, field or slot that owns an object's storage. |
| **ticket** | Temporary read access to an object that stays with its holder. An aggregate parameter is a ticket: it can be used during the call but not stored or returned except as an alias the signature declares. |
| **lease** | Direct access to a node held in the caller's own owning local, for the length of a call or a `select` arm. |
| **`var` parameter** | A parameter the routine may change, written `var` before its name. |
| **move** | Handing ownership of a pool slot to a new owner, written `move x`. The source is left empty. |
| **free** | Releasing a pool slot when its owner is finished with it. Always automatic. |
| **pool** | A fixed number of slots of one record type, reached through handles, used for dynamic or graph-shaped data. |
| **handle** | A reference to a pool slot: owning (`nodes`, `nodes?`) or an identifier (`id nodes`, `id nodes?`). |
| **arena** | A region freed all at once, for temporary data within a scope. |
| **blob** | The unit the linker places or removes: one routine, constant or variable. |
